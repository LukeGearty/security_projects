# Security Projects
A collection of hands-on programming projects focused on cybersecurity concepts and principles. The focus of this project is to move beyond theory and into how security mechanisms work and how they can be improved.

# Project Goals
* Deepen my personal understanding of real-world security concepts.
* Explore offensive and defensive techniques. 
* Practice programming from a cybersecurity perspective.

# Encryption Projects
Two introductory cryptography projects implementing basic encryption techniques:
* Caesar Cipher
* Transposition Cipher

Demonstrates:
* Fundamentals of symmetric encryption
* Naive encryption schemes


# SQL Injection Demo
Status: Work in Progress

A purposely insecure login page designed to demonstrate SQL injection vulnerabilities. 

Demonstrates: 
* Unsanitized user input leads to SQL Injection.
* Common insecure authentication patterns


# Password Strength
A web based tool that evaluates password strength based on length and character variety.

Demonstrates:
* Password entropy concepts.

# File Integrity Monitor
A command line tool for detecting file system changes using cryptographic hashes.

Features: 
* Generate baseline snapshot of directory
* Store file names and hashes in JSON manifest
* Re-scan directories to detect: 
    * Modified files
    * Newly added files


Demonstrates:
* file integrity monitoring principles
* Use of cryptographic hashes for tamper detection


# File Analyzer
A command line tool that analyzes files by comparing their file extensions and file magic numbers (file signatures).

Demonstrates:
* Why file extensions cannot be trusted by themselves.
* How malware can disguise itself.

# Phishing Security Training Campaign Manager
Status: Work in Progress

A tool intended to help design and manage phishing awareness training campaigns.
